# Algorithm Visualizer

Algorithm Visualizer is a web application built using ReactJS that allows users to visualize various sorting algorithms in action. It provides an interactive platform to observe how different sorting algorithms rearrange elements in an array step by step.

## Features

- Visualize sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort and Selection Sort.
- Generate random arrays of integers for visualization.
- Choose a sorting algorithm and start the visualization.
- Responsive user interface with interactive animations.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Algorithm Visualizer project, simply clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Himansh1975/Algorithm-Visualizer.git
